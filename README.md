# Array-Simulator-

Array Simulator was design with beginners in mind. Arrays can be a difficult topic to understand, however with this web app, the user can visualize how some of the most basic methods for manipulating arrays works. The idea is to have good fundamentals before continuing. 

I designed this application to help others but to also solidify my understand of arrays and of the avaiable methods.
